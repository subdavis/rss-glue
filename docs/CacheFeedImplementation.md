# CacheFeed Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the `CacheFeed` class as described in the ImageCachePlan.md. This feature allows RSS Glue to cache images from feed content locally, avoiding CORS issues and broken/expired links.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **rss_glue/feeds/cache.py** (NEW)
The main implementation file containing:

- **CachedFeedItem**: A FeedItem wrapper that intercepts render() calls to cache images
  - Finds all `<img src="...">` tags using regex
  - Downloads remote images via HTTP requests
  - Stores images in FileCache under `images/{namespace}/` directory
  - Replaces remote URLs with local relative paths
  - Gracefully handles failures (logs errors but continues)

- **CacheFeed**: A BaseFeed wrapper that wraps another feed
  - Takes any feed as a source
  - Passes through most functionality (title, author, origin_url)
  - Creates CachedFeedItem wrappers for all source posts
  - Properly implements the sources() method for dependency resolution
  - Updates when source feed updates

### 2. **rss_glue/feeds/__init__.py** (MODIFIED)
Added CacheFeed to the module exports:
```python
from .cache import CacheFeed
```

### 3. **README.md** (MODIFIED)
- Added CacheFeed to the Meta Data Sources section
- Updated configuration example to show CacheFeed usage

### 4. **test_cache_feed.py** (NEW)
Comprehensive test script that:
- Creates mock feeds with HTML image content
- Tests CacheFeed wrapping and update logic
- Uses mocking to simulate HTTP downloads
- Verifies URL replacement works correctly
- Validates data structures and post loading

### 5. **demo_cache_feed.py** (NEW)
Demo script showing real-world usage with an actual RSS feed (BBC News example).

## Key Features

### Composability
CacheFeed follows the same pattern as DigestFeed and MergeFeed:
- Takes a source feed as input
- Wraps posts from that feed
- Can be composed with other meta-feeds
- Properly declares its source in the sources() method

### Image Caching Strategy
- Images are identified via regex: `<img\s+[^>]*src=["']([^"']+)["'][^>]*>`
- Only external URLs are cached (skips data: URLs and local paths)
- Images are stored with hash-based filenames for uniqueness
- File extensions are preserved from original URLs
- Supports common image formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg

### Error Handling
- Failed downloads are logged but don't break the feed
- Original URLs are preserved if caching fails
- Network issues don't prevent feed generation

### Storage Integration
- Uses global_config.file_cache (FileCache) for storage
- Images stored under `images/{namespace}/` directory structure
- Generates relative URLs for proper serving via web server
- Cache is persistent across runs (files stay on disk)

## Usage Example

```python
from rss_glue.feeds import RssFeed, CacheFeed
from rss_glue.outputs import HtmlOutput

# Create a source feed
source = RssFeed("my_feed", "https://example.com/feed.xml")

# Wrap it with CacheFeed
cached = CacheFeed(source)

# Use in outputs
artifacts = [HtmlOutput(cached)]
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Lazy caching**: Images are downloaded when render() is called, not during update()
   - This allows for on-demand caching
   - Failed downloads can be retried on next render
   
2. **Hash-based filenames**: Using short_hash_string(url) ensures:
   - Unique filenames per URL
   - No filesystem path issues
   - Consistent naming across runs

3. **Relative paths**: Cached images use relative URLs like `/images_cache_namespace/hash.jpg`
   - Works with any base_url configuration
   - Compatible with static file serving

4. **Non-intrusive**: Failed caching doesn't break feeds
   - Original URLs remain if download fails
   - Errors are logged for debugging

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- ✅ Feed wrapping and initialization
- ✅ Post wrapping and metadata preservation
- ✅ URL detection and replacement
- ✅ Multiple images per post
- ✅ Posts without images
- ✅ Data structure integrity
- ✅ Source/cache namespace separation

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements that could be added:
- [ ] Cache expiration/cleanup based on age
- [ ] Image optimization (resize, compress)
- [ ] Support for background-image CSS properties
- [ ] Cache statistics and monitoring
- [ ] Parallel image downloads for performance
- [ ] Support for srcset attributes

## Integration with Existing Code

The CacheFeed integrates seamlessly with:
- ✅ FileCache infrastructure (already in place)
- ✅ BaseFeed abstract class
- ✅ FeedItem data model
- ✅ Logging system (NamespaceLogger)
- ✅ Update and sources() architecture
- ✅ All output formats (RSS, HTML, etc.)

No changes were needed to existing code - CacheFeed is a pure addition that follows established patterns.
